    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed CNN-RNN architecture consists of a pre-trained CNN as the encoder and a custom-built RNN as the decoder. The RNN utilizes an embedding layer to convert the target captions into dense vector representations. These embeddings are then fed into an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer with an input size of 256 and a hidden size of 512. The LSTM layer is responsible for capturing the sequential information and generating meaningful representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, a dropout layer is applied after the LSTM layer. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the LSTM outputs to zero during training, which helps in reducing the reliance on specific features and encourages the model to learn more robust representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a linear layer is used to convert the LSTM output into a vocabulary index. This layer maps the LSTM output to the size of the vocabulary, allowing the model to predict the next word in the caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ```transform_train``` function, the provided transform is a series of image transformations that are applied to the training images before they are fed into the CNN architecture. These transformations are designed to augment the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given transformation set includes operations such as resizing, cropping, and normalization. These operations help to standardize the input images and make them suitable for the CNN architecture. Resizing ensures that all images have the same dimensions, which is important for the CNN to process them efficiently. Cropping can help remove unnecessary background or irrelevant parts of the image, focusing the model's attention on the important features. Normalization is used to scale the pixel values to a standard range, which helps the model learn more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the provided transformations, I have also included ```transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip()```. This transformation randomly flips the image horizontally, which can help increase the diversity of the training data. By randomly flipping the images, the model learns to recognize objects from different orientations, making it more robust to variations in the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is responsible for generating the captions based on the encoded image features. It consists of layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells and linear layers. The parameters of the decoder need to be trained to learn the language model and generate accurate captions. By including `decoder.parameters()` in the trainable parameters, it is ensured that the decoder's parameters are updated during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder.embed represents the embedding layer of the encoder. This layer maps the input image features to a lower-dimensional space. The embedding layer is typically pretrained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on the specific task at hand. By including `encoder.embed.parameters()` in the trainable parameters, the embedding layer is allowed to adapt to the specific image captioning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, selecting `params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters())` as the trainable parameters is a good choice because it allows the model to learn and optimize both the language model and the image representation. By updating these parameters during training, the model can improve its captioning performance and generate more accurate and meaningful captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training deep learning models. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to provide efficient and adaptive learning rates for each parameter. This adaptive learning rate helps the model converge faster and more reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate, which is set to 0.001, determines the step size at each iteration during training. A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence, but it may also cause the model to overshoot the optimal solution. On the other hand, a lower learning rate may result in slower convergence but can help the model fine-tune its performance more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific value of 0.001 for the learning rate has been chosen based on experimentation and observation of the model's performance. It is important to note that the optimal learning rate can vary depending on the dataset, model architecture, and other factors. It is often a good practice to start with a reasonable learning rate and then adjust it based on the model's performance during training."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
